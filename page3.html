    <dt><p style="font-family:verdana;">Zenitsu is a demon slayer and a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. Although he was
         originally roped into joining the Corps by his mentor Jigoro Kuwajima, Zenitsu later realizes
         the importance of the Demon Slayer Corps and serves the corps with absolutely 
        loyalty as he wishes to repay his debt to Kuwajima for giving him a purpose.</p></dt>
